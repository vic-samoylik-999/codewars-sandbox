# Codewars (and others) Sandbox
Playground and Storage for interesting tasks (Codewars, freeCodeCamp, RSSchool, etc)

In this repo I save all the interestin challenges and algoritmic tasks, that I solve. In main folder is actually playground "main" and MD's listings of some challenges (that I solved or not yet). In folder "Interesting" I stored tasks that I already solve in actuall JS with some cooments.

The main sources, where I grab tasks or challenges:
- freeCodeCamp JS path;
- Codewars
- Stage 0 and Stage 1 of RSSchool (when I went throug it)
- other
